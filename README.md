## About

This project was initially made for myself, but I wanted to share it with you, fellow manga and anime fans. It mainly provides online streaming sources, allowing you to watch subbed and dubbed anime directly within the Seanime App. More providers will be added overtime.

## Installation
1. Open the streaming source that you want to add to the app (I.E. src/AnimeKai)
2. Open the manifest.json (I.E. src/AnimeKai/manifest.json)
3. Click ***RAW*** on the top right side of the page. It will open a new tab. Copy the URL
4. Open the extension tab on the Seanime App
5. Paste the URL
6. Click ***Install***
